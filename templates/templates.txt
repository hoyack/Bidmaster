Place .ODF LibreOffice Writer files here.

Whatever placeholder text is mapped against the Source CSV will be merged.

Placeholder can be specified in the Maps file .json template.

For example in the .ODF if any instance of `{{first name}}` appears then it can be merged and replaced based on the mapped field.
